            <h2>Long Hair</h2>
            <p>There are many breeds of cats with long hair. Some of the most popular are the persian, the maine coon, the ragdoll, and the siberian. Cats with long hair require more maintenance than cats with short hair. Depending on age, health, and texture of the fur, you may have to do some grooming for the cat. It is important to comb a long hair catâ€™s coat to keep it healthy, prevent it from becoming matted, and prevent hairballs.</p>

            <h2>Short Hair</h2>
            <p>Additionally, cats can have short hair. Some common cat breeds with short hair are the exotic shorthair, the british shorthair, the american shorthair, and siamese. Cats with short hair require less grooming than long hair cats. It is still important to brush the coat occasionally, though, to help get rid of any excess fur and prevent excessive shedding.</p>

            <h2>Other</h2>
            <p>Most cats have straight, soft, fur with a decent length and thickness, but there are some breeds, some classified as short hair cats, with curly, wiry, or thin to no hair. The rex breed has curly hair, the sphynx is hairless (pictured below), and the american wirehair has wiry hair. Some people are drawn to these breeds because of their unique coat.</p>
